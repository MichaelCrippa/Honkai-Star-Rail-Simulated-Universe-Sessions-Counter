    How to run

UNZIP ALL FILES IN THE SAME FOLDER AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DELETE ANYTHING BY ACCIDENT.
-----------------------
That said, now all you have to do is double-click "run_counter.bat"
-----------------------
IF YOU WANT TO TURN OFF THE MUSIC DO IT FROM THE SYSTEM: Just type VOLUME MIXER in the Windows search box and Search for "SU Run Counter", than turn it to 0.

The counter reaches a maximum of 50, then you will have to reset it, otherwise change the settings by modifying the Java file.
